# civ14-launcher

The is a windows client for [Civilization 14](https//github.com/civ13/civ14)that includes an auto-updater to fetch the latest code from the git repository automatically.

No installs required - it's standalone. Just extract and run.

Includes version checking. Supports both locally hosted servers and the official civ13.com server.

## Running

1. Run `civ14.exe`. If this is the first time you are running the game, it will automatically download the game files. This should take 5 minutes or so, depending on your internet connection. In the future the auto-updater will only take a few seconds.

2. On the main screen, you will see two textboxes, one for **Username** and one for the **Server Address**. Choose an username and put the address of the server you want to join (`civ13.com` for the official server, `localhost` to join a locally hosted server).
